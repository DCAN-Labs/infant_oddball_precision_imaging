code in this folder was used to 
1. calculate overlap in beta maps between subjects

2. calculate overlap in BOLD timeseries between subjects for different regions of interest

labels for time series analysis:

16786	left auditory	red
17088	right auditory	red
4604	left medial suppl. motor	yellow
4368	right medial suppl. motor	yellow
25480	left occipital	yellow
25967	right occipital	yellow
16010	right parietal	blue
16142	left parietal	blue
28498	right medial frontal	blue
28456	left medial fronatl	blue

3. calcualte overlap between beta maps and template matching derived networks for all subjects
